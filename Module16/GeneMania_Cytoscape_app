# Module 16 Practical Lab: GeneMANIA using Cytoscape 

## Goal of this practical lab 

Create GeneMANIA networks starting from a single gene to predict its function or starting from a gene list. Explore and understand the main output features of GeneMANIA such as the network composition or the enriched functions. 

This practical consists of 3 exercises. You can choose to do these exercises using the questions as your only guide (section 'QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW) - or see the following pages for the step-by-step checklist to finding the answers (section 'ANSWERS: DETAILED STEPS AND SCREENSHOTS'). 

Before starting the exercises,download the files:

*	[30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/master/Pathways/module5_lab/30_prostate_cancer_genes.txt)

*	[Mixed_gene_list.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/master/Pathways/module5_lab/mixed_gene_list.txt)

NOTE: Network layouts are flexible and can be rearranged. What you see when you perform these exercises may not be identical to what you see in the tutorial, or what you have seen other times that you have performed the exercises. Exact layouts and predictions can also be affected by updates to the networks database that GeneMANIA uses. However it is expected that the network weights and predicted genes will be similar to those shown here. 

## EXERCISE 1: QUESTIONS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW

1)	Imagine that you are interested in exploring the function of the human GRN gene: GRN returned as the strongest hit from your omics experiment but not many information about this gene is available in functional databases. Use GeneMANIA to identify its predicted function as well as potential interaction partners. 

**Skills**: GeneMANIA Single Gene search; Navigating Search Results; Exploring  available Genes features;  Rerun a new analysis using a single gene or multiple genes query from the network.

### STEPS

1. Go to GeneMANIA’s homepage at <http://www.genemania.org/>  

2. In the search window, ensure that the model organism is set to *Homo sapiens* ![homo](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/Up.png?raw=true).  

3. Enter the following gene: GRN	

4. Click on the search icon ![search](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/Search.png?raw=true) and wait for the results.	

5. When your search results load, examine the network. Genes you searched with are indicated with stripes, related genes added by GeneMANIA are represented in black, and colored links represent the interactions that connect the nodes (genes). **Tip**: zoom in and zoom out using trackpad or mouse scrolling up and down using the mouse or trackpad or zoom in to the maximum using the specific icon ![arrow](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/arrow.png?raw=true).
 	
6. Clicking on a node gives information about the name of gene, the possibility to add, remove this gene or search with this gene only. Click on the GRN node and explore the displayed information. 	

7. Locate the Functions summary tab (bottom left icon ![circle](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/circle.png?raw=true)). What are the functions significantly associated with  this network?  GRN is the central node of this network: which function would you predict for GRN? How well did GeneMANIA perform (hints: use GeneCards (<http://www.genecards.org/>) , PubMed (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/>))?	

8. Locate the gene with the strongest association with GRN. **Tip**: this gene is the largest node on the network. 	

9. Re-run an analysis by adding SORT1, HSPG2 to the search. Click on SORT1, click on Add  ![add](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/add.png?raw=true) or type the name of the gene in the search box. Do the same for HSPG2.  The genes are now added to the search box and a new network is automatically created.  Which functions are associated with this new network ![circle](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/circle.png?raw=true)? 	 

10. On the left side of the window are located icons that we haven’t yet explored. The first 3 buttons are activating different network layouts. Try the circular ![circular](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/circledot.png?raw=true), the aligned ![aligned](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/twodown.png?raw=true), and the force_directed ![force](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/crossing.png?raw=true) layouts.  	

11. Choose your favorite layout and save the  network as an image  using the *Network image As Shown* option from the *save*  menu ![save](https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/HT-Biology_2017/blob/master/Pathways/img/mod5/save.png?raw=true).
