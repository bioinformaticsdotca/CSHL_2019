# Additional Resources

### Griffith Lab 
The Griffith lab has developed material for more than RNA-sequencing that we used in this workshop:
* [RNAseq](https://rnabio.org/) (with additional material we didn't have time to cover)
* [Genomic Data Vizualization and Interpretation](https://genviz.org/)
* [Precision Medicine](https://pmbio.org/)

### Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops
CBW hosts several bioinformatics workshops primarily during the summer. 
* Topics this year include [Cancer](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/bioinformatics-for-cancer-genomics/), [Epigenomics](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/epigenomic-data-analysis/), [Metabolomics](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/informatics-and-statistics-for-metabolomics/), and [R Analysis](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/introduction-to-r/)
* [Topics from previous years](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/workshops-2018/)


### The Carpentries 
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) provide low-cost 2-day workshops on fundamental skills on scientific computing. Lesson material is freely available online, but attending a workshop is a great way to get hands-on experience and help from instructors. 

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) has general workshops on [command-line programming](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice), [version control with git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and intro to programming in either [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation) or [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation).
* Additional material is available online for [Make](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice), [version control with Mercurial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice), [SQL](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey), and [MATLAB](http://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation).
* [Upcoming workshops](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/)

[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) has field-specific themed workshops on data organization, cleaning, management, analysis, and/or visualization.
* Themes are [genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop), [ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop), [geospacial data](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-curriculum), and [social sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-curriculum).
* [Upcoming workshops](https://datacarpentry.org/workshops-upcoming/)


### Rosalind Problems
If you'd like to practice coding for solving biological problems, the [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) collection can be a fun way to do so.
